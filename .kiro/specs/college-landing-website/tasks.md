i didn't said simple just change the zig zag layout and don't mess with hover animations.

and increase the container widht and add area for an image and height for mobile for the place of and image. image will be placed on right for larger screens and top on mobile screens.

just increase the widht of the main container  in which text container will be present and those have animations.  and also add suitable margin from left and right as in previous generation it was touching the borders
